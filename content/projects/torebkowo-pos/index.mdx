This was a POS application made for Torebkowo.com.pl brick-and-mortar store.

Rather than building a native application, we decided to use Electron to speed-up our development process.
This allows to use native components like communicating with label and receipt printers combined with familiar web technologies like HTML and CSS.

The project also was setup to use Travis and AppVeyor for CI/CD. As soon as a commit was assigned version tag, the project was built and distributed to the end user.
This allowed me to develop the app for Windows users on macOS and quickly know when something went wrong.
